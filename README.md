## 💡What I Learned
While building this to-do list app, I gained a deeper understanding of how to manipulate the DOM with vanilla JavaScript, handle user events, and manage dynamic data. I also learned how to store data persistently using localStorage, which allows tasks to remain even after refreshing the page. This project helped me improve my problem-solving skills, particularly in updating, deleting, and marking tasks as completed efficiently. Additionally, I practiced designing a clean and user-friendly interface, which reinforced the importance of usability in web applications. Overall, this project taught me how to combine functionality and design in a small but complete web application.
